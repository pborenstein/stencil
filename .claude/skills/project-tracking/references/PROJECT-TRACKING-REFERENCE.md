# Documentation Guide - Project Tracking

> **Purpose**: Complete guide to the project documentation system
>
> **Audience**: Contributors, LLMs, future maintainers

---

## Documentation Philosophy

**Design Priority**: Optimize for fast, complete session pickup with minimal token usage.

### Core Principle: Hot State vs Cold Storage

The system separates two distinct needs:

1. **Hot State** - "Exactly where I left off" (volatile, small, fast)
2. **Cold Storage** - "What happened historically" (permanent, detailed, searchable)

### File Purposes

- **CONTEXT.md** = "Current session state" (30-50 lines, read every session)
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md** = "What we're doing" (current phase detailed, past phases compressed)
- **DECISIONS.md** = "What we decided" (heading-based, grep-friendly)
- **chronicles/phase-N.md** = "Detailed history" (session-by-session narrative)

**Goal**: Session pickup in < 2 minutes, reading only CONTEXT.md

## File Details & When to Update

### CONTEXT.md (Hot State)

**Purpose**: Ultra-compact file containing ONLY volatile session state

**Target size**: 30-50 lines max

**Structure**:

```yaml
---
phase: 3
phase_name: Production Hardening
updated: 2025-12-31
last_commit: abc1234
---

## Current Focus
[1-2 sentences: exactly what we're working on]

## Active Tasks
- [ ] Task currently in progress
- [ ] Next task after that
- [ ] Blocked: [reason] - task that's blocked

## Blockers
[Empty if none, otherwise 1-2 lines per blocker]

## Context
[3-5 bullet points of "things I need to remember"]

## Next Session
[1-2 sentences: where to pick up if starting fresh]
```

**When to update**:
- End of every session (session-wrapup command)
- Completely overwrite, never append
- If it exceeds 50 lines, you're doing it wrong

**What goes here**:
- Current task in progress
- Blockers preventing progress
- Decisions in flight (not finalized)
- Gotchas discovered recently
- Exactly where to continue

**What DOESN'T go here**:
- Historical context (goes in chronicles)
- Finalized decisions (goes in DECISIONS.md)
- Completed tasks (check them off in IMPLEMENTATION.md)

**Rules**:
- No history
- Maximum 5 context bullets
- Maximum 3-5 active tasks
- Update `updated` date every session

---

### IMPLEMENTATION.md (Progress Tracker)

**Purpose**: Living todo list organized by phases

**Target size**: 400-600 lines total

**Structure**:

```markdown
# Implementation

## Phase Overview
| # | Name | Status | Commits |
|---|------|--------|---------|
| 0 | Foundation | ✅ Complete | abc-def |
| 1 | MVP | ✅ Complete | ghi-jkl |
| 2 | Features | 🔵 Current | mno-HEAD |
| 3 | Production | ⚪ Planned | - |

## Current Phase: Features

[DETAILED section with 200-300 lines]
[Task lists with checkboxes]
[Sub-phase breakdown]
[Notes and blockers]

## Completed Phases

### Phase 0: Foundation
- Set up project structure
- Implemented core models
- Basic CLI interface
- Testing framework
See: chronicles/phase-0-foundation.md

### Phase 1: MVP
- User authentication
- Basic search functionality
- Database migrations
- Initial deployment
See: chronicles/phase-1-mvp.md

## Future Phases

### Phase 3: Production
[High-level goals, 5-10 bullets]
```

**When to update**:
- During session: Update task checkboxes in current phase
- End of phase: Compress completed phase to 3-5 bullets
- New phase starts: Add new current phase section

**Size enforcement**:
- **Current phase**: 200-300 lines (detailed)
- **Completed phases**: 3-5 bullets each + link to chronicles
- **Future phases**: High-level only (5-10 bullets)

**What goes here**:
- Phase overview table
- Task lists with checkboxes
- High-level achievements
- Links to chronicles for details

**What DOESN'T go here**:
- Detailed implementation notes (goes in chronicles)
- Decision rationale (goes in DECISIONS.md)
- Session-by-session narrative (goes in chronicles)

---

### DECISIONS.md (Decision Registry)

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for all architectural decisions

**Format**: Heading-based (grep-friendly)

**Structure**:

```markdown
# Decisions

Architectural decisions for this project. Search with `grep -i "keyword" docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Active Decisions

### DEC-001: Use PostgreSQL for primary database (2025-12-15)

**Status**: Active

**Context**: Need reliable storage for structured data with complex queries.

**Decision**: Use PostgreSQL as primary database instead of MongoDB or SQLite.

**Alternatives considered**:
- MongoDB: Better for unstructured data, but our data is highly relational
- SQLite: Simpler, but doesn't scale for multi-user access

**Consequences**: Requires PostgreSQL in deployment, but provides ACID guarantees and complex query support.

---

## Superseded/Deprecated

### DEC-000: Use MongoDB (2025-12-10)

**Status**: Superseded by DEC-001

**Context**: Initial assumption that unstructured data would dominate.

**Decision**: Originally chose MongoDB for flexibility.

**Why superseded**: Data became more structured. Switched to PostgreSQL for better query support.
```

**When to update**:
- New decision made: Add new heading-based entry
- Decision superseded: Move to Superseded section, add reference

**What goes here**:
- All architectural decisions
- Full context and rationale
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences and trade-offs

**What DOESN'T go here**:
- Implementation details (goes in chronicles)
- Temporary notes (goes in CONTEXT.md)

**Rules**:
- One heading per decision (### DEC-XXX: Title)
- All detail in one place (no duplication)
- Chronicle entries just reference "See DEC-XXX"
- Searchable with: `grep -i "keyword" docs/DECISIONS.md`

---

### chronicles/phase-N-name.md (Detailed History)

**Purpose**: Session-by-session implementation journal for each phase

**Entry template** (slim version):

```markdown
## Entry XX: Title (YYYY-MM-DD)

**What**: [1-2 sentences - what was accomplished]

**Why**: [1-2 sentences - context/motivation]

**How**: [Bullet points - key implementation details, max 5-7 bullets]

- Key change 1
- Key change 2
- Key change 3

**Decisions**: [Optional - only if DEC-XXX made, otherwise omit section]

- DEC-XXX: [one-line summary, detail in DECISIONS.md]

**Files**: [key files changed, or "see commit abc1234"]
```

**Target size**: 15-20 lines per entry

**When to update**:
- End of session (if significant work done)
- NOT for trivial updates

**What goes here**:
- Session narrative (what happened and why)
- Implementation approach
- Key code changes
- Interesting discoveries
- References to decisions

**What DOESN'T go here**:
- Full decision details (goes in DECISIONS.md)
- Current status (goes in CONTEXT.md)
- Exhaustive file lists (use git commits)

A longer `chronicle-entry-full.md` template is available for complex sessions.

## Session Workflows

### Session Pick-Up Process

**Goal**: Start working in < 2 minutes

#### Step 0: Verify the checkout is current (before reading any tracking file)

If this is a git repo, confirm the local checkout is up to date before trusting
CONTEXT.md:

```bash
git fetch
git rev-list --left-right --count @{upstream}...HEAD   # left = behind, right = ahead
```

- **Behind** (left > 0): tracking files may describe commits this checkout
  doesn't have. Warn the user, recommend reconciling, and offer `git pull --rebase`.
  Do NOT trust CONTEXT.md's contents until reconciled.
- **Diverged** (both > 0): warn the user and reconcile (rebase is usually right)
  before planning new work on the diverged tip.
- Let the user decide; never auto-reconcile without confirmation.

**Why**: CONTEXT.md's `updated`/`last_commit` are self-reported and can look
fresh while the checkout is behind. Tracking files sometimes land via out-of-band
pushes (including other projects' sessions), so a recent frontmatter date is NOT
proof the local checkout is current.

#### Step 1: Read CONTEXT.md (30-50 lines)

```bash
cat docs/CONTEXT.md
```

This file contains:
- Current focus and active tasks
- Blockers preventing progress
- Key context to remember
- Where to pick up next

**If CONTEXT.md exists**: You're done! Start working.

**If CONTEXT.md missing or stale**: Fall back to IMPLEMENTATION.md (see below)

#### Step 2: Fall back to IMPLEMENTATION.md (if needed)

```bash
# Find current phase
grep -n "🔵" docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md

# Read current phase section
# (Use line number from grep, read ~200-300 lines)
```

#### Step 3: Check deeper context (optional)

Only if you need historical background:

```bash
# List chronicle files
ls -t docs/chronicles/

# Read recent entries in current phase file
```

---

### Session Wrap-Up Process

**Goal**: Update CONTEXT.md and relevant docs in < 5 minutes

#### Step 1: Update CONTEXT.md (Required)

Update frontmatter:
- `updated`: Today's date
- `last_commit`: Latest git commit hash

Update sections:
- **Current Focus**: What we're working on now
- **Active Tasks**: Current task list (check off completed)
- **Blockers**: Any impediments
- **Context**: 3-5 key things to remember
- **Next Session**: Where to pick up

**Keep under 50 lines total**

#### Step 2: Update IMPLEMENTATION.md (if tasks completed)

- Update checkboxes in current phase section
- Mark completed tasks as ✅
- Add new tasks discovered

#### Step 3: Add Chronicle Entry (if significant work)

Only if meaningful work completed:

- Add entry to `docs/chronicles/phase-N-name.md`
- Use slim template (15-20 lines)
- Reference decisions, don't duplicate them

#### Step 4: Update DECISIONS.md (if decisions made)

If architectural decisions were made:

- Add new heading-based entry
- Include context, alternatives, consequences
- Update chronicle to reference "See DEC-XXX"

#### Step 5: Commit Changes

```bash
git add docs/
git commit -m "docs: session wrapup - [brief summary]"
```

## Size Targets & Limits

| File | Target Size | Maximum | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------|-------|
| CONTEXT.md | 30-50 lines | 50 lines | Strict limit |
| IMPLEMENTATION.md | 400-600 lines | 600 lines | Compress completed phases |
| Chronicle entry | 15-20 lines | 30 lines | Use slim template |
| DECISIONS.md | Variable | - | One heading per decision |

**Enforcement**:
- If CONTEXT.md exceeds 50 lines, you're tracking too much
- If IMPLEMENTATION.md exceeds 600 lines, compress completed phases
- If chronicle entry exceeds 30 lines, use bullets not paragraphs

---

## Templates

Templates are in `skills/project-tracking/assets/`:

- `CONTEXT.md` - Hot state template
- `chronicle-entry-template.md` - Slim entry (15-20 lines)
- `chronicle-entry-full.md` - Full entry (optional, for complex sessions)
- `decision-entry-template.md` - Heading-based decision
- `DECISIONS.md` - Full decisions file template

---

## Best Practices

### Do

- Update CONTEXT.md at end of every session
- Keep CONTEXT.md under 50 lines
- Use slim chronicle template by default
- Put decision details in DECISIONS.md, not chronicles
- Compress completed phases to 3-5 bullets
- Read only CONTEXT.md for session pickup

### Don't

- Let CONTEXT.md grow > 50 lines
- Skip updating CONTEXT.md (it becomes stale)
- Duplicate decision details across files
- Keep verbose completed phase summaries
- Create chronicle entries for trivial updates
- Read IMPLEMENTATION.md when CONTEXT.md exists

---

## Troubleshooting

### "CONTEXT.md is stale (updated > 7 days ago)"

**Problem**: CONTEXT.md hasn't been updated recently

**Solution**: Run session-wrapup to update it, or read IMPLEMENTATION.md current phase

### "CONTEXT.md is too long"

**Problem**: File exceeded 50-line limit

**Solution**:
- Move completed tasks to IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Move finalized decisions to DECISIONS.md
- Reduce context bullets to top 5 most important
- Simplify "Next Session" to 1-2 sentences

### "Not sure if I should create a chronicle entry"

**Guideline**: Create entry if:
- Implemented a feature or fixed a bug
- Made an architectural decision
- Discovered something non-obvious
- Future you would want to know "how did we solve X?"

**Skip entry for**:
- Trivial updates (typo fixes, small tweaks)
- Work still in progress
- Just updating documentation

### "Where do I document this decision?"

**Always**: Put full details in DECISIONS.md

**Then**: Reference "See DEC-XXX" in chronicle entry

**Never**: Duplicate decision rationale across multiple files

## FAQ

### Why no CHRONICLES.md index file?

`ls docs/chronicles/` lists all phase files. `grep "^## Entry" docs/chronicles/*.md` lists all entries. A separate index file provides no value over the file system and search.

### Why a slim chronicle template?

Chronicles are cold storage, rarely read during pickup. Write-fast is better than exhaustive documentation. Git commits capture file changes; decision details live in DECISIONS.md.

### Why heading-based DECISIONS.md?

Each decision gets a heading with full details — grep-friendly, single source of truth, room for context and consequences. Chronicle entries just reference "See DEC-XXX".

### What about a collection of related projects?

This guide covers tracking within a single project. If you're coordinating
several projects that each have their own independent git history, use the
`project-repo` skill to initialize a meta-repo that tracks shared conventions
and coordination across them. Each member project still uses the documentation
system described here on its own.

### What if my project doesn't have phases?

Use time-based organization:

- chronicles/2025-Q1.md
- chronicles/2025-Q2.md

Or feature-based:

- chronicles/authentication.md
- chronicles/search-feature.md

The core principle remains: separate hot state (CONTEXT.md) from cold storage (chronicles).
